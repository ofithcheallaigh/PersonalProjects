us. I\u2019m currently in the situation where I have a family and and money seems to run out halfway through the month. I work a full time job, 9-6 in a chemist Mon-Fri and it\u2019s just not enough. I am seriously considering doing UberEats\/Deliveroo but I have no friends I know who do so I\u2019m not too sure if it\u2019s worth getting into. I\u2019d only be doing it after 6PM till like 12PM most of the time. Anyone on here have any experience and whether or not it\u2019s even worth doing?","4":"So my neighbour's gardener has started cutting half of the top of the hedge.

Have I missed something??","16":"The road near me has recently been covered in loose chippings. About 2 miles long. This is a nightmare to drive on. Does anyone know the purpose of this? \n\nThe road didn't seem in too bad a condition before doing this.","17":"Controversial title but it\u2019s true. Recent events have reminded us all that there is a large group of people on this island who truly hate the majority of the population. They have purposely resisted any form of integration at every turn, react with extreme violence at the slightest perceived insult, have an utterly contemptuous attitude to those outside their in-group and are primarily responsible for the recent periods of violent disorder here, both in the 20s and the 60s-90s. This group of people is referred to as \u2018loyalists\u2019 due to their supposed loyalty to the crown.\n\nIt\u2019s important to differentiate between unionism and loyalism here. Unionism is a perfectly valid political opinion to hold, as is nationalism, and if anyone tells you otherwise, they\u2019re a prick. Loyalism can best be defined as \u2018unwillingness to compromise\u2019, as it is at heart a settler-colonial ethnic identity rather than one defined by politics. If your family is loyalist, you are likely to be loyalist yourself. Few \u2018convert\u2019 to loyalism \u2013 it is not a proselytising faith. There is a reason these people fly Israeli flags and it\u2019s not just the siege mentality\n\nHow many are there? DUP voters are not all loyalists, anymore than SF voters are all republicans, as these are mainstream parties who attract a broad range of views from across their \u2018side\u2019. The fringe parties are a much better gauge: TUV and PUP voters are overwhelmingly likely to be loyalists, in the same way that the 17 people still voting for the Irps are almost certainly republicans. This gives a figure of 68k on a turnout of 63%, so around 100k potential voters. Estimating the percentage of DUP voters who are diehards is nearly impossible, so I\u2019ll pull 50% from my arse and use it, which gives 90k voters at 63% or around 140k overall. Add the figures and you get 240k, just shy of a quarter million. That\u2019s a smidge over 10% of the population of NI, ~3% of the population of the whole island.\n\nWhat should be done about this tiny minority? My suggestion is very simple: complete deplatforming alongside a strategy of total boycott, divestment and sanctions. No more Wee Jamie on the radio, no more Jim screaming in the Assembly, no more Sir Jeff smarming on the news, no more fat govt contracts for Wrightbus, no more peace money for community groups, no more fat brown PSNI envelopes for touts. Those who dislike this treatment and wish to leave for Britain or Canada should be warmly sped along their way with grants. Those who kick off should face the full, overwhelming force of the law and face criminal conviction as terrorists, or simply shot in the back of the head without trial, as happened back in the day.\n\nThis needs to start NOW, well prior to any serious plans for unification, as if it isn\u2019t then the loyalists will throw spanner after spanner in the works. They will howl and scream about how their views aren\u2019t being respected, but there is no possible way to placate them because they cannot be placated in a united Ireland as it is anathema to them. They will try their absolute hardest to undermine and stop the inevitable process, and they\u2019ll cause a hell of a lot of hurt in doing so. Afterwards, they will remain a festering sore on the arse of this country unless something is done, and the sad truth is that the Irish state is very weak and likely to be incapable of dealing with such a problem on its own. The British state has the tools, techniques and power in place to get this done, and ultimately it\u2019s their mess which they need to clean up.\n\nIf anyone has any better ideas, please let us all know in the comments.","18":"I have two spare standing tickets to drive be by truckers on vicar street in Dublin today \n\nAny takers no charge","19":"Any man,dog,woman,child,leopard gecko know where I can get a red spar hat for Donegal rally next week","20":"","21":"","22":"","23":"","24":"","25":"","26":"\n\n[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/v9ogv7)","27":"","28":"Hey folks, \n\nNew subreddit for anyone interested in Pharma or science careers in Ireland.

My husband and I are traveling to Dublin on July 17th and will get in very early on July 18th. We plan to stay in Dublin for at least a day\/night, and will then head to Belfast where we will likely stay in an Airbnb the rest of the week. What are some things we absolutely MUST see? We will have a car, so we have also considered driving to Galway and visiting different spots in between. I work for an airline (so airfare is free) and this has been a very last minute decision. I\u2019ve always wanted to visit Ireland and finally convinced him (coming from Texas) because most of our trips together have been to Caribbean islands. Now that we have settled on coming to Ireland all suggestions are welcome and appreciated. I would like to add that while we will have an Airbnb in Belfast, since we will have a car we are also considering grabbing a hotel somewhere if we venture out and don\u2019t want to drive back. All in all I cannot wait to visit as it\u2019s been on my list for quite some time! If we have time I would also really like to take a ferry to Scotland.

A massacre his party bend over backwards disassociating themselves from. One they're adament was carried out by an unsanctioned splinter group. One Republicans have long condemned.\n\nThen, where is the pattern of behaviour showing that McElduff is bigoted? How can you suggest that a man jumps from being not even mildly offensive to being grotesquely so, in the course of a morning?

I've seen people saying he would have known, but that's absolute bullshit. There would have been a very small number of people waking up on that day thinking it's the anniversary of Kingsmill. I guarantee you weren't one of them, so why would Barry have been?\n\nWhat content of the video indicates that he was referring to the massacre? He talks about the bread in the shop and makes zero reference to anything political, never mind the killings which have all the previous reasons going for why he wouldn't.\n\nIt makes absolutely no sense for anybody to assume that this was an act of bigotry and not a bizarre coincidence. Even if you assume he is a bigot, which there is no evidence for and plenty to the contrary, it would be the kind of act never before seen by ANY politician in recent times and certain to be severely detrimental to him.\n\nNow don't just jump in with \"you're defending a bigot, that's inexcusable\", actually address the points here and don't skip to the conclusion I've shown makes no sense and for which there's no evidence for outside of pure chance.","297":"","298":"I've recently just become a dad.
