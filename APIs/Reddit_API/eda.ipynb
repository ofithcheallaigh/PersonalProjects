From the south but I’ve been living in the UK (mostly England) over 10 years, thought the north will be a nice middle ground between the two. Quick nip down the motorway or over on the ferry to Scotland to see family etc.\\n\\nI’ve only really visited Belfast, been a few times over the years which I always really enjoyed. In mid 30s now and a bit burnt out with city living so I don’t really love the idea of living central, but anything close to one would be fine, suburb type areas I guess, countryside is fine too, just nothing crazy remote. Doesn’t have to be near Belfast though! Just wherever anyone thinks would be a nice chill safe place to live. No kids, self-employed remote worker with transport and a decent rental budget (£3k tops).\\n\\nAlso any tips for what rental sites to check out would be great. Thanks so much! If there’s any other info that would help please let me know, I really appreciate anyone’s time in helping.',\n",

I have noticed a couple hundred fans from NIR these days here in capital Prishtina and i must say they are giving a great vibe to our boring city since we barely see any tourist here (because of lack of attractions and poor promotion i guess). \\nLast couple of days we have noticed lots of Irish people in our main square just drinking, singing and having fun with the locals. It’s an eye-opening experience for most of people here because of bad stereotypes people used to have about british football fans.\\nBest of luck for the match tonight :)',\n",

Is anyone aware of anywhere in Belfast or close by that are needing volunteers?\\n\\nI have previous experience volunteering with Animals for Almost Home in Moira. Particuarly interested in helping Animals, Litter picking, Anything helping the environment in general, helping the homeless.  I have done a little research on my own but failing to find anything that is organised for litter picks regularly, Cats protection dont require any volunteers at the moment and anything outdoorsy looks to be organised for retired people / people on evening shifts as they tend to be early mornings/afternoon times.\\n\\nThank you,\\n\\nSara',\n",
