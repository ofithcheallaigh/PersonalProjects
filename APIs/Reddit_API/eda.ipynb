       "  '17': 'Controversial title but it’s true. Recent events have reminded us all that there is a large group of people on this island who truly hate the majority of the population. They have purposely resisted any form of integration at every turn, react with extreme violence at the slightest perceived insult, have an utterly contemptuous attitude to those outside their in-group and are primarily responsible for the recent periods of violent disorder here, both in the 20s and the 60s-90s. This group of people is referred to as ‘loyalists’ due to their supposed loyalty to the crown.\\n\\nIt’s important to differentiate between unionism and loyalism here. Unionism is a perfectly valid political opinion to hold, as is nationalism, and if anyone tells you otherwise, they’re a prick. Loyalism can best be defined as ‘unwillingness to compromise’, as it is at heart a settler-colonial ethnic identity rather than one defined by politics. If your family is loyalist, you are likely to be loyalist yourself. Few ‘convert’ to loyalism – it is not a proselytising faith. There is a reason these people fly Israeli flags and it’s not just the siege mentality\\n\\nHow many are there? DUP voters are not all loyalists, anymore than SF voters are all republicans, as these are mainstream parties who attract a broad range of views from across their ‘side’. The fringe parties are a much better gauge: TUV and PUP voters are overwhelmingly likely to be loyalists, in the same way that the 17 people still voting for the Irps are almost certainly republicans. This gives a figure of 68k on a turnout of 63%, so around 100k potential voters. Estimating the percentage of DUP voters who are diehards is nearly impossible, so I’ll pull 50% from my arse and use it, which gives 90k voters at 63% or around 140k overall. Add the figures and you get 240k, just shy of a quarter million. That’s a smidge over 10% of the population of NI, ~3% of the population of the whole island.\\n\\nWhat should be done about this tiny minority? My suggestion is very simple: complete deplatforming alongside a strategy of total boycott, divestment and sanctions. No more Wee Jamie on the radio, no more Jim screaming in the Assembly, no more Sir Jeff smarming on the news, no more fat govt contracts for Wrightbus, no more peace money for community groups, no more fat brown PSNI envelopes for touts. Those who dislike this treatment and wish to leave for Britain or Canada should be warmly sped along their way with grants. Those who kick off should face the full, overwhelming force of the law and face criminal conviction as terrorists, or simply shot in the back of the head without trial, as happened back in the day.\\n\\nThis needs to start NOW, well prior to any serious plans for unification, as if it isn’t then the loyalists will throw spanner after spanner in the works. They will howl and scream about how their views aren’t being respected, but there is no possible way to placate them because they cannot be placated in a united Ireland as it is anathema to them. They will try their absolute hardest to undermine and stop the inevitable process, and they’ll cause a hell of a lot of hurt in doing so. Afterwards, they will remain a festering sore on the arse of this country unless something is done, and the sad truth is that the Irish state is very weak and likely to be incapable of dealing with such a problem on its own. The British state has the tools, techniques and power in place to get this done, and ultimately it’s their mess which they need to clean up.\\n\\nIf anyone has any better ideas, please let us all know in the comments.',\n",

The street art was absolutely incredible. It's genuinely breathtaking how many amazing artists seem to reside there. In London you'd expect it to be tagged over fairly quickly but pretty much everything was in pristine condition. I would genuinely recommend that people visit just to see the street art because it's that good. \\n\\n7. Taytos are quite nice and you can clearly tell the difference between them and other brands.
