Our neighbour gave us some dog food and a lead to borrow, so I guess it's staying with us tonight and we'll take it to a vet tomorrow\n\nEDIT 2: the dogs owner contacted my fiance about an hour ish ago, it's been safely returned home, turned out it was on our street, was being looked after by the couples kids (parents went away for the weekend) and from what another neighbour said the dog had been missing since noon (ish).

My husband and I are traveling to Dublin on July 17th and will get in very early on July 18th. We plan to stay in Dublin for at least a day\/night, and will then head to Belfast where we will likely stay in an Airbnb the rest of the week. What are some things we absolutely MUST see? We will have a car, so we have also considered driving to Galway and visiting different spots in between. I work for an airline (so airfare is free) and this has been a very last minute decision. I\u2019ve always wanted to visit Ireland and finally convinced him (coming from Texas) because most of our trips together have been to Caribbean islands. Now that we have settled on coming to Ireland all suggestions are welcome and appreciated. I would like to add that while we will have an Airbnb in Belfast, since we will have a car we are also considering grabbing a hotel somewhere if we venture out and don\u2019t want to drive back. All in all I cannot wait to visit as it\u2019s been on my list for quite some time! If we have time I would also really like to take a ferry to Scotland.

Love the fact that I could just look up the route and go there myself without having to book with a separate company. \n\n3. Titanic Museum was great. I'm sure you guys are probably sick of hearing this from tourists but I'm absolutely not surprised that it's one of the most popular places to visit. Loved the Game of Thrones stained glass windows on the way there too. \n\n4. Everyone seemed really friendly and had smiles on their faces. Staff genuinely seemed happy after helping me out. \n\n5. No one seemed to care that I was obviously a tourist. People just kept to themselves which is what I'm used to. \n\n6. The street art was absolutely incredible. It's genuinely breathtaking how many amazing artists seem to reside there. In London you'd expect it to be tagged over fairly quickly but pretty much everything was in pristine condition. I would genuinely recommend that people visit just to see the street art because it's that good. \n\n7. Taytos are quite nice and you can clearly tell the difference between them and other brands. I do plan on ordering some of the Taytos chocolate tonight because I couldn't find any in stores. \n\n\n\nRandom question though.

Organiser Harold Henning, deputy grandmaster of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, described it as a \u201ccelebration of thanksgiving for this wee country of ours, for the 100 years we have had\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and for the future\u201d.\n\nThe parade will be a highlight of this year\u2019s loyalists\u2019 marching season, which has proved a source of conflict between the mostly Protestant unionists, who favour Northern Ireland remaining part of the UK, and the mostly Catholic nationalists who favour a united Ireland.\n\nMervyn Gibson, grand secretary of the Orange Order, kicked off the parade calling for customs checks on goods remaining in Northern Ireland to be scrapped: \u201cNo tweaking, no tampering, no fudge\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009no excuses\u201d.\u00a0\n\nHe said the region must also not be subject to foreign laws.\n\n\u201cIf the Protocol is not sorted, then make no mistake\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009there will be no next 100 years for Northern Ireland,\u201d the Presbyterian minister said. \u201cThe cry to those who seek to persuade us, Protocol us or push us into a United Ireland is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009No Surrender!\u201d\n\nSome fear that with tensions high over the fallout from Brexit, which has divided the region\u2019s main political parties along similar lines and left it in political limbo, it might not take much for loyalist tempers to boil over.\n\n\u201cIt is tinderbox territory,\u201d said Alex Kane, former head of communications for the Ulster Unionist Party.\n\nRiots erupted last year, as a younger generation of loyalists channelled anger at post-Brexit trading arrangements \u2014 which have created a customs border in the Irish Sea. Loyalists and unionists say the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol undermines their UK identity and want it scrapped.\n\nThe protocol imposed checks on goods entering from Britain in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. An open border was a key element of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement that ended the three decades-long Troubles involving British security forces as well as republican and loyalist paramilitaries.\n\nThe UK government has warned that the protocol is undermining the Good Friday Agreement and has vowed to introduce a bill within weeks to rip up parts of the protocol unilaterally unless the EU agrees changes.\n\nTensions have flared more recently. In March, loyalist paramilitaries were blamed for a sinister bomb scare in Belfast targeting Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney.\n\nThere were security fears again this week when Congressman Richard Neal, who led a US mission to try to build bridges, had his Northern Ireland schedule leaked to loyalist paramilitaries, according to a report in the Belfast Telegraph.\n\nAhead of his trip, Neal told the Financial Times that sporadic violence remained a risk. \u201cThe danger is it would be the amateurs. It gets out of hand fast.\u201d\n\nWinston \u201cWinky\u201d Irvine, a spokesman for loyalist groups cautioned: \u201cWe are at a very dangerous juncture, there\u2019s no question in my mind.\u201d He added: \u201cPoliticians aren\u2019t being seen to deliver. That\u2019s creating a very dangerous vacuum.\u201d\n\nNo one believes there is any serious danger of turning back the clock to the Troubles. \u201cThere are stirrings of unrest among loyalist paramilitaries,\u201d said Jon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see more widespread violence.\u201d\n\nStill, the political temperature has risen sharply since elections earlier this month won by nationalist Sinn F\u00e9in, long considered the mouthpiece of the republican paramilitary IRA. The party is committed to reuniting Ireland.\n\nThe long-dominant Democratic Unionist Party responded by boycotting the Stormont assembly and vetoing any new power-sharing executive until the customs border in the Irish Sea is scrapped.\n\nSarah Creighton, a unionist political commentator, fears loyalist youths could turn to violent protest on the streets as happened at Easter last year. \u201cThere does seem to be a \\[younger\\] generation of loyalists that seem to be agitating to show their anger.\u201d\n\nThe Coveney scare was a hoax \u2014 albeit one that Irvine said appeared to have been \u201csophisticated, well-organised, well-planned.\u201d But Creighton said what worried her \u201cwas the message that was sent\u201d.\n\nPolitical tensions have been rising since February, when the DUP pulled out of the executive over its Irish Sea border demands.\n\nJohn Stevenson, a grassroots loyalist activist in Portadown, said loyalist groups had given the party an ultimatum a week beforehand: \u201cPull down the executive this week or we\u2019ll be out on the streets protesting.\u201d The DUP said it \u201cdoes not recognise\u201d that version of events.\n\nWhile he saw no appetite within loyalism for any return to a military-type campaign, Stevenson said political instability carried risks. \u201cIf it\u2019s not resolved, it may go further,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Irvine, who is considered close to the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force, Brexit has \u201creignited all the animosities and all the markers of division\u201d. The dangerous message is \u201cif politics can\u2019t fix it, the street will fix it,\u201d he said.\n\nJackie McDonald, a senior figure in the paramilitary Ulster Defence Association who was jailed during the Troubles, said veterans did not want to return to violence. But he said some younger people felt they did not want to be \u201cthe generation that failed\u201d their community and took the view: \u201cWe will not be told what to do by the grey-haired old men\u201d.\n\nHe warned: \u201cIf the protocol isn\u2019t sorted out, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d\n\nKane acknowledged that he, like many others, had been blind to the unexpectedly strong electoral performance of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice party, which is uncompromising in its anti-protocol stance. He noted there had also been loyalist rallies ahead of the elections. \u201cSo there\u2019s something happening on the ground, and that\u2019s worrying.\u201d\n\nHe said the protocol row had created an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d among the loyalist community \u201cabout their identity, their citizenship,\u201d adding that he hoped there was \u201cenough common sense\u201d to avoid violence.\n\nAdditional reporting by James Politi in Washington","288":"How do the likes of just eat, uber etc ensure your ice cream doesn't melt?

Donaldson,\n\nAs a meme her of your constituency, the fact that you ran on a ballot as an MP was a clear message to us that you intended to step down as MP and take up your seat as an MLA. You have instead decided to stay on as MP and co-opt someone else in your place. First of all. You where elected, not Emma Little-Pengelly. Therefore she is an unelected official.\n\nYou lied to us. This is unacceptable.\n\nA by election should be called as soon as possible to put it to those who elected YOU, to see if they would elect ELP. You have no right to deceive the electorate who voted for you in this way and it\u2019s disgraceful.\n\nFollowing on from this, people are struggling in our constituency and many others over the current cost of living crisis and the fact that the cost of fuel to get to and from work as well as to pay for goods is becoming extremely difficult.\n\nYou have decided for me that the Northern Ireland Protocol is more important than anything I am facing. You have decided for me that an issue at the national level where you still hold a seat in Westminster, is enough to not bother trying to help me or people like me at the local assembly level.\n\nYour priorities are all wrong and you are showing a clear disregard for your constituency and the people of Northern Ireland.\n\nFor once, I am compelling you to do the right thing instead of the wrong thing.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAnd his reply:\n\nThank you for your email dated the 12th May. \n \nI note your concerns surrounding the co-option of Ms Emma Little Pengelly onto the Northern Ireland Assembly in my absence, the cost of living and the importance we place on removing the Irish Sea Border.\n \nThere are two points I would like to raise in response to the appointment of Emma:\n \nThe people of Lagan Valley gave me a mandate based on my commitment to right the wrongs of the Irish Sea Border. To do this, I am best served in Westminster for the time being, where I can effectively lobby the UK Government for the removal of the Irish Sea border. The co-option of my colleague Emma Little-Pengelly is planned to be a temporary nomination allowing me on my return to the Assembly to hold my mandate from the people of Lagan Valley.  At that point, there will be a by-election for my Westminster seat.  My mandate to be an MP remains valid until the point of my resignation whereupon there will be a by-election to fill the vacancy in the House of Commons.  My mandate to take up my seat at Stormont will remain valid for the next five years unless there is a further Assembly election in the intervening period.\n \nCo-option is a legitimate mechanism within the Northern Ireland Assembly, and while I note your concerns, all parties across NI have used this feature during the last mandate, with some 29 co-options occurring between 2017-2022. Sinn Fein was responsible for 14 and the Alliance party for four, with their leader Naomi Long herself availing of two co-options. The difference between many of those co-options and mine is that I am fully committed to returning to become a Member of the Legislative Assembly for Lagan Valley, and I am doing all I can to make that happen promptly.\n \nThe cost of living and the NI protocol are interlinked, so I will address both items together.\n \nLast September, I set out in some considerable detail the strategy that the DUP would adopt in relation to our continuing opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol.  The protocol is very harmful to Northern Ireland even though it has only partially been implemented at this stage due to the continuation of the so-called grace periods.  There is substantial evidence to demonstrate the harm that the protocol is causing for many businesses in Northern Ireland who trade with Great Britain as our biggest market.  It is worth noting that we purchase four times more goods from Great Britain than we do from the whole of the EU, and we sell far more goods to Great Britain than to the entirety of the European Union.  Consequently, the Irish Sea border is causing enormous difficulty for businesses trading into and purchasing goods from our biggest market.  Additionally, the Road Haulage Association have stated that the increased cost in the transportation of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland as a direct result of the protocol is in excess of 27% in the first year of its operation.  This additional transportation cost is being passed on to the consumer and contributes significantly to the rising cost of living here.    For example, chilled products sold in supermarkets in Northern Ireland are now some 18% higher in cost than they are in the same supermarkets in Great Britain.  This is directly attributable to the protocol.  We believe these matters need addressing urgently and the Irish Sea border removed.  \n \nFollowing my statement last September, we have taken certain actions to make clear that our Ministers are not prepared to impose the protocol and harm our economy and the people of Northern Ireland.  Ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive are expected to fully apply EU regulations over which we have no control and into which we have no say.  It is an entirely undemocratic situation that not a single elected representative in Northern Ireland has any say on how the EU draws up these regulations, and yet our Ministers are expected to implement the regulations in full in a most harmful way.  This is not a sustainable position.  That is why I took the action to withdraw the First Minister from the Executive at the beginning of February in protest at the fact that no action has been taken to address the difficulties created by the protocol.\n \nBefore the election and during the election campaign, we clearly set out in our Manifesto that we would not appoint Ministers to the Northern Ireland Executive until such times as decisive action was taken on the protocol.  In the Assembly election, we received a large mandate for our Manifesto position, and I fully intend to honour the mandate that we have been given.  Perhaps it is the case that politicians should say one thing at election time and then do a complete about-turn after the election in defiance of the wishes of the people that voted for them.  I am afraid that I am not that kind of politician. I fully intend to keep my word to the people who voted for us and ensure that decisive action is taken on the protocol before we nominate Ministers to the Executive.  In the meantime, my Ministers who are in charge of the Department for the Economy, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the Department of Education will continue in their posts. They will take decisions that ensure the smooth running of those Departments throughout the forthcoming period.  Ministers remain in all of the other Government Departments, including the Department of Health. They can make decisions that ensure our Health Service and other public services continue to operate effectively.  In addition, I am also committed to beginning discussions immediately with the other political parties to agree on a Programme for Government and a 3-year budget so that we can then proceed with these matters as soon as the Executive is formed.  \n \nIn our election Manifesto, we also outlined the measures that we intend to take to support hard-pressed families, including 30 hours of free childcare per week for working families and others, an additional \u00a31billion immediate investment in the Health Service with more to come, thus creating the resources for an additional 750,000 procedures in the Health Service and driving down waiting times.  We also stated our plans to create an additional 20,000 new jobs in Northern Ireland.  The DUP is absolutely committed to working with the other parties to tackle all of the issues that are before us as soon as political stability can be restored.  You will have noted that Northern Ireland has been included in recent special payments and measures announced by the UK Government to help with the cost of living.  The DUP lobbied hard at Westminster to ensure this happened and we will work with the Treasury to ensure these payments are allocated to households as soon as possible. \n \nThe Belfast\/Good Friday agreement is clear.  Power-sharing can only work effectively with cross-community consensus.  Given that not a single Unionist MLA elected to the Assembly supports the protocol, that consensus does not presently exist.  It needs to be rebuilt, and solid foundations again put in place for stable government here.  Therefore, the Government must take decisive action now to address the problems created by the Northern Ireland Protocol.  As the Court of Appeal in Belfast confirmed, the protocol has changed our constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom.  This constitutional change has taken place without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland in contravention of Article 1 of the Good Friday Agreement.  The protocol also changes the need for the cross-community voting mechanism in the Assembly, which are at the heart of the principle of power-sharing by consensus.  It is essential that power-sharing by consensus is restored to ensure continuing political stability and that we can work together in a divided society.  I find it incredible that parties who once argued consensus was the way forward in Northern Ireland are now talking about some form of \u201cmajority rule\u201d when they were unable to accept this when Unionists had the majority.  The Government must act to restore the principle of consensus at the heart of power-sharing in our devolved institutions.\n \nIn conclusion, I am absolutely committed to playing my part, as is my Party, in building a more stable, peaceful, and prosperous Northern Ireland.  The protocol is harming our ability to achieve this.  It needs to be dealt with, and the sooner the Government takes decisive action on this front, the sooner political stability can be restored.  Please be assured that I am committed to making this happen as quickly as possible.  \n \nIn the meantime, we will continue to engage with the other political parties to find ways to ensure the Ministers that remain in place are able to deliver the support that individuals and families need at this time.  \n \nThank you for taking the time to share your views with me on your important concerns.

In the run-up to the 1916 commemorations in the South there was an intense debate about the merits of a positive remembrance for an event which led to the loss of many civilian lives, wrecked Dublin's city centre, and arguably had no solid democratic mandate, even if the ultimate result was independence for (most of) Ireland. There were television debates where both points of view were given equal weight and Unionists were invited to participate in events in a spirit of reconciliation. Nationalist Ireland was gripped by an intense conversation over how best to mark the centenary.\n\nToday's event will not be a time of reflection. The names of every human life lost during the Partition of Ireland will be not read out in front during a ceremony. There will be no time given to reflect on the rejection of democracy by UVF paramilitaries, or the pogroms of Catholics in Belfast, Lisburn, etc. No remembering the thousands of Catholics and so-called \"rotten Prods\" driven from workplaces. There will be no acknowledgement of the fact that the pseudo-colonial state born a hundred years ago oppressed, marginalised, and discriminated against the minority, or that we're still dealing with the legacy of that today (see: Irish Language Act). Indeed the organisation behind the parade is explicitly anti-Catholic, and many of the bands participating are linked to paramilitary organisations. The Soldier F banners will hardly create a welcoming atmosphere either. There's a reason shops are closing early today.\n\nSo yeah, sure for many they'll feel right at home at today's march.

It's a bit of a long one so I hope you will bear with me and read it all.\n\nI was born in South Belfast but moved to England in 1977 at the height of the troubles. I come from a staunch loyalist family and as a youngster, I played in loyalist flute bands.  I left the province as I was getting drawn into the fringes of loyalist paramilitaries.  Many friends and members of my wider family did get involved and spent time behind the wire in Long Kesh etc.\n\nPolitically I am and have pretty much always been a socialist.  Last year I relocated from the South of England to Scotland in the hope that Scotland will become an independent country.  I have struggled with the concept of nationalism but my hatred of the Tories and the neanderthal DUP has outweighed my concerns.\n\nI have seen firsthand the fears harbored by the unionist community over the prospect of a united Ireland.  Make no mistake, many unionists really fear that their culture is under a huge amount of threat.\n\nI paid a short visit to Belfast a fortnight ago and during the trip, I did a political walking tour of the Falls Road. I am 61 next week and this was the first time I have ever set foot on the Falls Road.  Our guide was a former IRA political prisoner called Brendan who was a blanket man and in Long Kesh during the hunger strikes.\n\nOur group was small, just me and a family of four from Spain.  As a result, I was able to spend a lot of time talking to Brendan about his experiences, his politics, and his hopes for the future.  As one might expect, Brendan looks forward to a united Ireland but it was his attitude to his unionist neighbors and to religion that surprised me the most.  Brendan doesn't identify as a Roman Catholic and is delighted to see that the Catholic church in Ireland has lost its influence.  Brendan's greatest wish is to see the peace wall come down so that he can live in peace, side by side with his protestant neighbors.  He bears no malice towards the unionist community, his ire is directed towards the British government, and the British government alone.\n\nI was amazed to find myself in total agreement with Brendan on almost every political issue we discussed.  I was also amazed to find the Falls Road so well kept and so friendly.  When the tour concluded I wandered from Milltown cemetery back to Divis tower by myself, taking photographs as I went.  I felt much safer on the Falls than I did when I wandered around Sandy Row and the Shankill road on my last visit.  Everyone I met was so friendly.\n\nI did note that the murals etc on the Falls Road tend to be marks of remembrance rather than the Pro UDA\/UVF murals I see in Loyalist areas.\n\nSo, what is the point of this post?  Well, it's partly to relate my experience, but I also wanted to highlight the fact that there is so much more that unites rather than divides the people of NI.  Our neighbors are not the enemy.\n\nI would like to encourage others to reach out and discover these things for themselves.  You might well be as surprised as I was.  There is less to fear than you might imagine.\n\nI am far from naive, I totally understand that taking these steps is really difficult for many people.  It isn't easy to forgive and forget the past, and it is hard to put aside your fears.  I totally respect that and I am not suggesting that it will change your political views.   However, gaining an understanding of those with a different political view can remove the fear factor, and it might just help to build a peaceful and prosperous future for everyone.  Surely that is something that everyone wants?\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zgjopcyc00291.jpg?width=2736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5ed72140c67446ebc3dd1ff4e6901b19f4d166b\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/llvcecyc00291.jpg?width=2736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f9ba1593438baa1bc5aa3ac2c65062660a685cb","420":"I\u2019m visiting elderly parents next week for a week and I\u2019ll need to cook , but don\u2019t eat meat.

I lived in Ireland and abroad for quite a while, but the DeLorean car and the folklore around the company and the plant in Belfast where it was made has always interested me (obviously back to the future was massive for anyone born in the 80s or 90s). Where I live now, every so often you see a DeLorean and it always makes me think of Belfast :)  \n\n\nI watched the Netflix documentary on John DeLorean there a few days ago and it dives deeper into the story of the man and the company. Clearly, he was an imperfect man, but he had great ideas and drive to build that car. Needless to say, the ending for the plant in Belfast was clearly a big blow to the workers and the area.  \n\n\nThe big thing I took away from the documentary was that all the workers pretty much had no experience assembling cars or much knowledge of cars at all, but they got stuck in and got the plant moving. I know the factory was taken over 6 or 7 years later by a French company who are there to this day (car parts manufacturer).  \n\n\nThe one thing I was wondering was if there were any companies or inventions that were formed by ex-workers at the plant?

To elaborate on the cause of my post , I was struggling with multiple addictions which however I could all afford at the same time , gambling and drugs ( multiple ). I have managed to stop both. The reason I am making this post is to do something useful instead and give back , I would like to help people who are struggling , may it be you are a family that can\u2019t feed themselves due to increasing prices or you are lonely and need someone to talk , stopping my addictions gave me both time and financial freedom to do something useful. There is no need to be afraid of me by the way , I have no illness , I did not consume anything that includes needles.
